/// An icon button is a picture printed on a [Material] widget that reacts to
/// touches by filling with color (ink).
///
/// Icon buttons are commonly used in the [AppBar.actions] field, but they can
/// be used in many other places as well.
///
/// If the [onPressed] callback is null, then the button will be disabled and
/// will not react to touch.
///
/// Requires one of its ancestors to be a [Material] widget.
///
/// The hit region of an icon button will, if possible, be at least 48.0 pixels
/// in size, regardless of the actual [iconSize], to satisfy the [touch target
/// size](https://material.io/guidelines/layout/metrics-keylines.html#metrics-keylines-touch-target-size)
/// requirements in the Material Design specification. The [alignment] controls
/// how the icon itself is positioned within the hit region.
///
/// See also:
///
///  * [Icons], a library of predefined icons.
///  * [BackButton], an icon button for a "back" affordance which adapts to the
///    current platform's conventions.
///  * [CloseButton], an icon button for closing pages.
///  * [AppBar], to show a toolbar at the top of an application.
///  * [RaisedButton] and [FlatButton], for buttons with text in them.
///  * [InkResponse] and [InkWell], for the ink splash effect itself.
