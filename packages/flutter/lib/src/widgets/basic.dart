/// When asked to paint, [CustomPaint] first asks its [painter] to paint on the

/// canvas matches the coordinate system of the [CustomPaint] object. The
/// painters are expected to paint within a rectangle starting at the origin and
/// encompassing a region of the given size. (If the painters paint outside
/// those bounds, there might be insufficient memory allocated to rasterize the

/// 2. Divide the remaining main axis space among the children with non-zero

///    factor. For example, a child with a flex factor of 2.0 will receive twice
///    the amount of main axis space as a child with a flex factor of 1.0.
/// 3. Layout each of the remaining children with the same cross axis
///    constraints as in step 1, but instead of using unbounded main axis
///    constraints, use max axis constraints based on the amount of space
///    allocated in step 2. Children with [Flexible.fit] properties that are
///    [FlexFit.tight] are given tight constraints (i.e., forced to fill the
///    allocated space), and children with [Flexible.fit] properties that are
///    [FlexFit.loose] are given loose constraints (i.e., not forced to fill the
///    allocated space).
/// 4. The cross axis extent of the [Flex] is the maximum cross axis extent of
///    the children (which will always satisfy the incoming constraints).
/// 5. The main axis extent of the [Flex] is determined by the [mainAxisSize]
///    property. If the [mainAxisSize] property is [MainAxisSize.max], then the
